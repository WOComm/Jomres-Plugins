Offers search endpoints to allow searching of the property database.

Plugin does not need an API client/secret pair to return results.

Note, the search functionality relies on the ajax search composite plugin's search features to return results, so you will need to install that too, although it doesn't need to be configured if you don't want to use jax search composite elsewhere on your site.
