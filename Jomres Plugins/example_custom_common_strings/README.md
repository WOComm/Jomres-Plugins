This plugin is designed to demonstrate how strings can be added to the Common Strings array in Jomres, which can then be used in any template without any additional coding. Open j00005example_custom_common_strings.class.php in /jomres/core-plugins/example_custom_common_strings and read the comments in that file to understand how to use this plugin.

It's intended for developers who have lots of custom strings that they want to add easily and not have to add them to every script they have.
