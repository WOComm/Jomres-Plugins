Designed to show the guest's shortlisted items in a sidebar. 

See the "Including script content from one page in another Jomres template file" section of the Site Designer's manual document to see how to include script content in another script.

Add a template shortcode (not the same as a normal shortcode) which looks like

{jomres_script my_shortlist} 

to a Jomres template file (e.g. property_details.html) to show guests a list of properties that they have added to their Favourites.
