# The Plugin Manager is used to download plugins from the Jomres plugins servers.

## Downloading plugins

### If you do not have a download and support license

You can choose to purchase individual plugins, you don't need a download and support license.

Pros : 

* Cheap as chips. A plugin download is just 1 euro.
* You only pay for the plugins you need. If you only want one plugin, this is the best option.
* Plugin installation purchases are cheaper than a download and support license.
* Jomres installs the plugin for you automatically.

Cons : 

* No support, either for Jomres or the plugin.
* One off purchase. Once the plugin is installed you will not receive updates for it. If you want to update the plugin you will need to purchase it again.
* If you uninstall the plugin you will need to purchase it again if you want to install it again.
* The purchase will only work once, so you must allow the purchase page to redirect you back to the Plugin Manager after you have completed the purchase, so **!do not close the browser tab!** until you've been redirected back to the Plugin Manager and seen the  installation success confirmation.
* If the installation fails for any reason you will need to purchase the plugin again. For this reason we recommend that you install at least one of the free plugins available in the Plugin Manager to ensure that your directory permissions are correctly set before attempting to purchase a plugin.
* There are no refunds. If you purchase a plugin and it doesn't work for you, you will not receive a refund. You can, however, contact us and we will try to help you get it working.

### If you have a download and support license

It's a one click process to install, update or remove a plugin. Plugins are regularly updated so this process allows you to get immediate, easy access to new versions of the plugins without needing to search through the website and manually upload them.

Pros :

* Access any plugins at any time. There's no extra charge.
* One click install, update and removal of plugins.
* Support for Jomres and the plugins.
* New plugins are added regularly, and existing plugins are regularly updated. You can get immediate access to these updates.

Cons :

* Subscriptions are charged monthly, bi-annually or annually. If you don't need to update your plugins regularly then this may not be the best option for you.
* You must have a valid download and support key saved in Site Configuration to use this feature.

## Uploading plugins

In the summer of 2023 we are introducing a new feature for the Plugin Manager called Community Plugins. This feature allows you to upload your Jomres plugins to the Jomres website and share them with other users. You can also download plugins that other users have uploaded.

Before you can upload plugins you will need to register (it's free) at [on the Jomres.net license server](https://license-server.jomres.net/index.php). 

See [this page on jomres.net for more information](https://www.jomres.net/jomres-plugin-list/community-plugins).
