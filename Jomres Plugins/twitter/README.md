This plugin allows Jomres to post to your twitter account whenever a new booking is made on a property, and to DM a manager on booking creation. Note that oauth functionality is required, so you will not be able to test this via a basic WAMP/Localhost installation. You will need to request app keys from twitter so make sure you have a twitter account.
