Allows property managers to create auctions for rooms in a property, or just auctions that aren't linked to rooms.


The Auction House is a full blown application that runs within Jomres. It adds a new icon to the property manager's toolbar which allows them to auction items (including rooms over defined periods) however they don't have to auction rooms.


Below you can see the two step process used to add an auction for rooms. This is useful if you want to create an auction for rooms as a business driver.

On the second step you can select Arrival and Depature dates. When done, you'll be able to select any rooms which are available between those dates to add to the auction. When the auction is saved, a Black Booking is created which will prevent those rooms from showing in the booking form.
