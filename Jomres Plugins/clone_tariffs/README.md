This plugin allows you to copy tariffs from one property to another. 

It is a property manager feature, the clone tariff menu option is added to the Jomres main menu. 

This plugin was designed particularly for those managers who have a lot of different properties, but only a handful of different tariffs. It makes creating tariffs for these individual properties much easier. Typically, they will have one unpublished property where they configure a variety of different tariffs. When a new property is created they can use this plugin to quickly import tariffs into the new property from the unpublished one.
