This plugin is designed to show the BS5 top panel and the ajax search composite plugin's output in a single area. Typically it would be configured to be shown somewhere near the top of a page, in a module or widget perhaps.

As a result you must install the BS5 top panel and ajax search composite plugins.

See the shortcodes page to see how to call this plugin's output.

It is, essentially, a wrapper for those two plugins.
