## Popular Properties

This plugin allows you to display popular properties.

A property's popularity is determined according to the number of clicks it has received, so it uses the information generated by the propertyClicked function in  [functions.php](https://github.com/WoollyinWalesIT/jomres/blob/master/libraries/jomres/functions/functions.php) which is triggered when the viewproperty task is triggered. 

There is a setting called asamodule_popular_property_uids which you can use to define properties to show. This can be used as a fallback if the asamodule_popular_ptype_ids filter didn't return any results. 

Typically used as a shortcode in a page or article.

See the shortcodes page for exact settings available.

This plugin uses the [get_property_module_data](https://www.jomres.net/manual/developers-guide-2/56-other-discussions/422-the-get-property-module-data-function) function to generate output.
