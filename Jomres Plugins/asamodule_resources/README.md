## Asamodule resources (rooms)

This plugin allows you to display a property's rooms.

Typically used as a shortcode in a page or article.


In most cases you would probably want to use the show_property_room or show_property_rooms shortcodes instead of this plugin, as they are newer, but this plugin remains available for backward compatability on older sites.
