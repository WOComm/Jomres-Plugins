This allows shortcodes to use {jomres cpanel} to access Jomres. It means that we can put Jomres into a hidden menu (i.e. it is not necessary to have a menu item for Jomres in the main menu). Menu items that are limited to, for example, Register users will not then work for normal guests. This is a workaround for that issue.
