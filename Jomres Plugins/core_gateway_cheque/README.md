# Jomres Core Cheque gateway is a very simple payment gateway for jomres.

It is enabled through the Property Configuration > Payment gateways tab by property managers.

When a guest chooses to pay by cheque when making a booking they are shown the property's address to send the cheque to. If the property manager has configured an address in Property Configuration, that will be used.

Once the booking has been inserted then a note will be added to the booking to confirm that the guest has opted to pay by cheque.
