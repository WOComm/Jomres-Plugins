Adds a new button to Admin > Jomres > Tools > Clone Property which you can use to clone properties.

Important note : Due to how the translation system in Jomres works, you may find that the new property name that you've entered isn't cloned with the new property name into the property switcher dropdown. 

As a result you will probably end up with a lot of new properties with the same name. If you want to add lots of properties, it's advisable that you use the API new property functionality instead.
