Logs page views. Does not provide any way of viewing output, instead this plugin replaces functionality that was removed from default installations of Jomres as some older users requested the functionality be restored.

Uses the jomres_page_view class to log when a property's property details page has been hit.

This class saves information to the xxx_jomres_pageviews table.
