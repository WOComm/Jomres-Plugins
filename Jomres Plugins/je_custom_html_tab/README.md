Custom HTML Tab plugin creates a new section in property details page where you can enter any HTML content you want by using the Joomla or Wordpress default html editor. This can be useful for those who want to show some specific information on the property details page but also keep the property description and other property details fields separate.

After successfully installing the plugin, a new button will be created in the Settings section of your manager control panel (frontend) > Settings > Custom html.

The content can be entered on this page using the html editor, which must be enabled from site configuration->misc tab, otherwise the html code will be stripped when saving.

The content entered here is language dependent, so use your CMS's language switcher to change the language and save the content in the new language.
