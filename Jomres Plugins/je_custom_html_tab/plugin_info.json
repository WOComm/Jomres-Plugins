This can be useful for those who want to show some specific information on the property details page but also keep the property description and other property details fields separate. \r\n\t\t\tAfter successfully installing the plugin, a new button will be created in the Settings section of your Jomres manager control panel (frontend). The tab content can be entered on this page using the html editor, which must be enabled from site configuration->misc tab, otherwise the html code will be stripped when saving. The content entered here is language dependent like the property description fields and it can be translated in the same way.","lastupdate":"2022\/05\/02","min_jomres_ver":"9.25.2","manual_link":"","change_log":" v2.1 User role related updates. v2.2  Removed references to Jomres Array Cache as it is now obsolete. v2.3 Menu options updated for menu refactor in v9.8.30 v2.4 Modified how array contents are checked. v2.5 Removed a check for admin area to allow scripts to call frontend menu in the administrator area. v2.6 CSRF hardening added. v2.7 French language file added v BS4 template set added v2.9 Italian language file added, thanks Nicola v3.0 Language files updated v3.1 Bootstrap 5 template set added. v3.2 Serbian lang file updated.","highlight":"","image":"https:\/\/snippets.jomres.net\/plugin_screenshots\/2017-08-03_qi93u.png","demo_url":"","compatability":["Bootstrap 2","Bootstrap 3"],"author":"Vince Wooll","authoremail":"sales@jomres.net","authorurl":"http:\/\/www.jomres.net"}}
