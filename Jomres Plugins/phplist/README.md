The PHPList Integrator plugin offers the possibility to integrate Jomres with the most popular open-source newsletter script available on the web. 

When a user makes a booking in Jomres, he will be added to a mailing list in PHPList. By using PHPList and this plugin, you`ll have more marketing possibilities, which may result in more bookings made on your site. 

All plugin settings can be configured in Admin > Jomres > Settings > Site Configuration > Integrations.

The PHPList Integrator plugin uses CURL to communicate with your PHPList script.
