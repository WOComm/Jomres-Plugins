### Bootstrap 5 only

Search results pages use special Jomres templates called Property List templates. They are different to the Basic Module Output template as they are designed to show multiple properties.

In Jomres you have by default two different layouts, List View and Photos View.

The BS5 Property List Templates plugin delivers a number of different plugins, and gives the site manager to choose the default template used. This configuration is done in Admin > Jomres > Settings > Site Configuration > List Properties templates tab.

In this tab the manager can choose the List view and photos view templates that Jomres should use.
