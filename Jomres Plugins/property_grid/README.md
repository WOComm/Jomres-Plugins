Display Properties in a Grid pattern.

Bootstrap 5 only.

Takes two different types of arguments, which can be used together: Property uids and the number of columns to be shown.

If property uids aren't set the plugin will find all published property uids, randomise them, then select 6 of them. 

If the number of columns wasn't passed then it will guess how many columns to show, based on the number of propertys it has been told to show.

Max is 6 columns. Uses the basic module function to produce results.
