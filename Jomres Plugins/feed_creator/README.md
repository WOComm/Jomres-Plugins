Creates a language dependent feed from all jomres propertys. Currently supports RSS 1.0 and RSS 2.0 feed formats.

Feeds can then be seen on urls like www.domain.com/index.php?option=com_jomres&task=feed_creator&jrajax=1

jrajax in the url prevents the system from showing any output except the xml itself.
