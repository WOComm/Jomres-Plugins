An evolution of the Extended Maps plugin.

Because it's an evolution it shares many of the Extended Maps plugin, but with a few small differences (Attractions and Events do not show on this map, for example)

Because it uses the new Google Advanced Mapping feature you will need to save both the Google Maps API key AND a Google Maps Map ID. 

[You can get a map id from here](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/studio/maps?project=localhost-38581)
