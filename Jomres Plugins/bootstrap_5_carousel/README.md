[Bootstrap 5 sites only.](https://www.jomres.net/blog/167-don-t-install-bootstrap-5-only-plugins-on-sites-that-aren-t-configured-to-use-bootstrap-5)

The Bootstrap 5 Carousel plugin is a direct override of the Jomres Core Galleria gallery plugin. It uses the slideshow images uploaded via the Frontend Media Manager.

You cannot call this script by itself, instead it takes over automatically once installed and uses Bootstrap 5 Carousel functionality to generate a photo slideshow/gallery.

Note, the Bootstrap 5 Property Details templates use their own BS Carousel functionality so if you have one of them installed they will use the code from their template files, not this one, so although the markup may look very similar, the sources are different.
