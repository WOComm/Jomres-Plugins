A plugin to allow us to bypass the confirmation page if required.

If more than one gateway is enabled, this plugin will not continue and instead will show the confirmation page and the guest can choose the gateway they want to pay via, however if none or just one gateway has been enabled then this plugin will skip over the confirmation page.

To enable the plugin you need to go to Site Configuration > Booking form tab and set "Bypass review booking page" to Yes.
