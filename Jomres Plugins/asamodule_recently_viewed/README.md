## Asamodule recently viewed

Show the properties that the visitor has recently viewed (seen the property details page of the property).

Typically used as a shortcode in a page or article.

You can pass arguments to it to limit the number of properties returned, and the orientation of the output.

See the shortcodes page for exact settings available.

This plugin uses the [get_property_module_data](https://www.jomres.net/manual/developers-guide-2/56-other-discussions/422-the-get-property-module-data-function) function to generate output.
