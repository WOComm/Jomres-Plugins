Extras can be added to bookings at booking time.

Despite this plugin being called Optional Extras, you can make some extras mandatory by setting the Force option in the Models section to Yes.

If you set the Automatically Selected setting to Yes, then the extra will be added to the booking if the guest does not un-check the checkbox, however if the Force option isn't configured then they can unselect it if they choose to.

During the booking process a guest must first choose the booking dates, and then the rooms/room types that they want to book. Once that has happened then Extras are revealed in the booking form. This allows property managers to configure Extras to only be available at certain dates, or to bookings of certain room types. Use the "Valid From" and "Valid To" and "Resource/Property type" settings to use these limitations.

If the property is an SRP then the (invisible) room is automatically chosen so the Extras will appear immediately.

The Models section at the bottom allows you to modify just how the Extra is charged.

Use the Property Manager's Media Centre to upload images for Extras.
