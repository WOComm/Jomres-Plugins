Allows the site admin to create room/resource features that can be assigned by managers to their rooms/resources and also allow managers to create their property specific room/resources features. 

Room/resource features are useful because if you enable the "classic" rooms list in the booking form then guests can search for rooms with specific features.

Room features are associated with rooms (not room types), and their images can be uploaded through the property manager's media centre page.

Once created and associated with rooms then room features can be used in the booking form to filter available rooms by the room feature.

They are also shown on the view room details page.
