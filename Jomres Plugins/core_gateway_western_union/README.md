# Western Union Payment Gateway

This Payment gateway allows both site and property managers to configure three sets of Western Union branches that payments can be made to. If required, site managers can configure their settings to override any frontend settings.

In Bootstrap 5 based sites guests are able to use the browser's copy feature to copy account details into the browser's clipboard.

Once the booking has been added then a note is added to the booking to say that the guest has opted to pay by Western Union.
