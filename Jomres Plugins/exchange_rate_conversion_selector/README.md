Provides the exchange rate selection dropdown that site users can utilise to show prices in their selected currency. Should be called by ASAModule or a discreet task (eg task=exchange_rate_conversion_selector). If you'd like to use the bootstrap template for putting dropdowns in the toolbar (a href based as opposed to select lists) add &alternate_template=1 to the ASAModule arguments.

This is not the same plugin as the top panel plugin, which shows the exchange rate selections in a modal.
