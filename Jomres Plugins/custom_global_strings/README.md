Lists and allows you to delete custom global strings. It's a list of all translations added to the xx_jomres_custom_text table that have a property uid of 0, which makes them global custom strings.

Adds a new button called Global Strings to the Jomres Admin Cpanel -> Translations section.

This is intended to help you remove global strings (I.E. strings with a property uid of 0) from the jomres_custom_text table that you may have inadvertently added. On occasion it has been known for people to use the editing mode whilst the Global Editing mode was enabled, and inadvertently create global property information. This may not be desired, and this page will give you the ability to remove any custom global strings that you do not need.

Less of a problem now that property managers have access to the dedicated translations page.
