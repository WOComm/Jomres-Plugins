Utility for deleting old managers from the Jomres Manager to Property Cross reference table. Most users will not need to install this plugin, however if you are using the Beds24 plugin and have deleted a manager using the CMSs User Interface, who at one time managed a property, then you may no longer be able to access that property. Cleaning the cross reference table should resolve this problem.
