Administrator area function. Empties the sessions table.

When a user visits the site, information is collected by Jomres (e.g. search settings so that search forms on new pages can be pre-filled to reflect what the user has already searched for previously, booking form requirements etc) and are stored in the Jomres sessions table. This provides a more userfriendly experience.

Jomres has schedule functionality that removes older records after a certain period of time (typically 24 hours) however on the off-chance that this hasn't worked, or simply because you are a developer and you want to clear out the sessions table, you can use this tool.

You can find it in Administrator > Jomres > Tools > Clear sessions
