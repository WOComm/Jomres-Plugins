The Stripe Standard payment gateway 

The older Jomres Stripe payment gateway was intended for users who want to split some of the value of the booking between site and property manager. It's complicated to setup and Stripe, bless them, keep changing their API so it doesn't work for everybody.

This gateway is different. It's simpler for managers to setup, they go to the Property Configuration page and setup the gateway for each property they manage by entering their secret key. Funds are NOT shared with the site owner's Stripe account therefore there's no administrator settings to configure.

Secret keys are unique to each property. Payment fees are charged to the property manager's account, not the site owner's account (if they even have one, they don't need one).
