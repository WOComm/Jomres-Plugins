$questions[] = [ 'question' => "What does a skipper do?", 'answer' => "A skipper will handle the boat for you, recommend routes, places to visit and make your holiday as relaxing as possible; if you wanted to have a go at sailing yourself but don't have as much experience, then this would be recommended as an option.
