Destroys data that is collected when making bookings. Is intended for developers who wish to clear their Jomres tables of test bookings and other data (bookings, invoices, guest details, subscriptions etc). Properties, settings, tariffs, rooms and other setup like this won`t be affected.

INTENTIONALLY HIGHLY DESTRUCTIVE, use at your own risk!

After it is installed it will add a new button called Data Wipe to the Jomres Admin Cpanel -> Tools section
