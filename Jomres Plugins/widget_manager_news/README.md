This widget gives Site Admin the ability to communicate site or wider news articles to their property managers through the Property Manager's control panel. It adds a new link Site News to the Portal section of the Administrator area and from there you can create small articles that will appear if the Widget has been enabled.

News articles can be global, or targetting at individual properties.
