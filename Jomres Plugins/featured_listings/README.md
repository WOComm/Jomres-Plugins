## Featured listings

Once installed this plugin creates a new menu item in Administrator > Jomres > Portal called Featured Listings

On this page you can then select which properties should be marked as featured.

Featured properties are special. When a search is performed, if any featured properties are returned in the search results then they are bumped to the beginning of the search results.

You can also define a class to show around a featured property when it is returned in search results, so in this example I configured the class to be "alert alert-success" and as you can see, the results are highlighted :
