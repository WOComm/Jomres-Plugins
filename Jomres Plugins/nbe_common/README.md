Provides a common object that the NBE (new booking engine) REST API functionality uses to make bookings.

The data required to build an object to build bookings is quite extensive, therefore the API uses this class to prepare all of that information.

The 06000nbe task doesn't do anything, it's used purely for testing creation of the booking object, so don't link to it.

If you want to see the code for how this plugin is used see the "Api Feature Booking" plugin code.
