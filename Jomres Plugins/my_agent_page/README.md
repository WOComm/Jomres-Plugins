Adds a link to a property manager's menu that will take them to their View Agent page. Not all sites will show links to the agent page in their html so this page allows the manager to view their publicly available information direct from their toolbar.

The view agent page can be called as a shortcode, using either a property uid or the manager's id, so you don't need this plugin, but it may be useful to some people.
