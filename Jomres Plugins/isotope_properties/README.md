## Isotope Properties

Displays property cards that can be filtered and sorted using buttons at the top of the output. Selects properties at random. 

Because all of the data is in the browser the guest is able to sort properties extremely quickly.

Typically used as a shortcode in a page or article.

You can pass arguments to it to limit the number of properties returned, and limit the list to properties of a certain property type.

The plugin is a modified version of the Featured Listings 3 plugin designed to show many more properties, not just Featured properties.
