Extends the property list pricing information to show exact pricing based on the items searched on. If you have a fast server, and you are concerned that prices in the property list be as accurate as possible, then use this plugin to enhance the prices output in the property list pages. It adds extra calculations when generating prices for various search parameters, and extra queries required to gather this information, so CPU and memory usage is increased slightly. Totals also include forced Extras. It does not cater to last minute and/or wise price settings, user specific discounts and fixed period bookings are not included.

This plugin will work on some sites, and not others as it attempts to calculate bookings values based on search parameters selected in search forms. Because each site is different, and each site's criteria is different this may or may not work for you. If you install it but don't like how "prices from" figures are calculated in the basic module data and property list pages, uninstall it again.

The booking form in Jomres is a very complicated beast. It offers a multitude of different parameters that can be selected before a booking's final price is known (optional extras, coupon codes etc, for example). This plugin will try to replicate some of those calculations for building the prices shown in search results pages and module/widget output areas.
