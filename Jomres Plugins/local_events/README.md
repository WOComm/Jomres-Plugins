The "What to do locally" and "What's happening?" pages are part of the same "Local Events" plugin.

Once relevant data is entered, then this information will be visible under the property details pages.

"What to do locally" refers to attractions that are typically available year-round, whilst "What's happing?" refers to events that cover specific time periods ( e.g. county shows )
