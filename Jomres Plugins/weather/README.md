Adds current weather to property details pages.

You will need an openweather api key, which you can then save in Administrator > Jomres > Settings > Site Configuration > Integrations tab

Once you have that then weather information will be added to the property details page.

Can also be used as a shortcode (e.g. for single property sites that don't show the property details page).
