A different kind of search feature, I threw it together as a bit of fun to see if I could provide a different way of searching for properties. This is designed for site managers who're targetting those middle income thirty-somethings who know they want to go on holiday, but don't know where. They only know that they want to spend a few pounds/euros/dollars and they want to do something (e.g. skiing). This plugin gives the visitor an input to enter a pound/euro/dollar/whatever amount and select a feature or features.

Use a shortcode like {jomres lucky_dip} to show this plugin's output. The guest enters a price they want to pay, and selects a property feature or features that are important to them, and then they hit search. Below you can see a screenshot with the results at the bottom.
